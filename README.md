# Vision AI Camera Quality 

Python-based camera quality benchmarking and validation tool designed to process video inputs, sample frames efficiently, and generate structured metrics for quality analysis and regression tracking.

## Why this project matters

Camera quality regressions are difficult to detect early without structured, repeatable analysis.  
This project focuses on building a reproducible video-processing pipeline that can be extended with camera quality metrics and Vision AI checks.

The emphasis is on:
- correctness
- performance awareness
- clean architecture
- automation readiness

## Key Features

- Video input pipeline using OpenCV
- Frame sampling for performance optimization
- Structured CSV output for regression tracking
- Modular architecture (I/O, processing, reporting)
- CLI-based execution (automation and CI friendly)
- Designed for incremental expansion (quality metrics, Vision AI)
